# Python Calculator

A simple command-line calculator built using Python. This program performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single run.

## Features

* Perform basic arithmetic operations:

  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (*)
  * Division (/)
  * Modulus (%)
* Handles division by zero
* Validates user input
* Continuous calculation option (press Enter to continue)
* Exit anytime by pressing **q**

## How It Works

1. User enters the first number
2. User enters the second number
3. User selects an operator (+, -, *, /, %)
4. The program displays the result
5. User can:

   * Press **Enter** to perform another calculation
   * Press **q** to exit the program

## Requirements

* Python 3.x installed on your system

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the file
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the program:

```
python calculator.py
```

## Example

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, %): *
Result = 50
Press Enter to continue or type 'q' to quit:
```

## Error Handling

* Displays error message for invalid numbers
* Prevents division or modulus by zero
* Shows message for invalid operators
